Leaning BB.JS

Back Bone path:

Rails router -> Rails controller -> index method (gets @dashboards) -> 
Renders index.html with #dashboards DOM element -> Jscript creates bb router and passes @dartboards -> 
The router routes to /index (based off of url) which points to "index" ->
index router method create a new indexview and passes in @dartboards ->
indexview specifies a template, passes @dartboards to it, and renders the html ->
index view adds all @dartboards to the DOM


    
main.js -> main app driver
/extra/html5_dartboard -> html5 dartboard (which updates scoreboard)
